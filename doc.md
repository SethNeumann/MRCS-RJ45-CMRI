This is the origianl CMRI Molex KK 156 to RJ45 board the John Plocher designed for Jay Beckham. 
The intent is better wire management on classic CMRI DIN/DOUT [24|32] boards. RJ45 cables can easily and
neatly be routed around to distribution points.

It turns out that 0.156 edge connectors (available from Acculites) can also be used in the MOLEX pads, allowing
for mular connections to Tortoise by Circuitron stall motors.

This September 2023 update is part of a file cleanup effort.
